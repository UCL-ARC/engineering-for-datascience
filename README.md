# COMP0235/COMP0259 Engineering for Data Science

This repository contains source code that students on the pair of modules "COMP0235" and "COMP0239" at UCL will need. It will be updated throughout the courses so remember to "pull" from the repository regularly.

Structure:

* `infrastructure/` -> this contains code to set up VMs of various types on Condenser. As part of the course you will learn how to write and extend this Infrastrucutre As Code (IAC).
* `lectures/` -> example files for lectures.
* `coursework/` -> helpful tools for the coursework exercises.
